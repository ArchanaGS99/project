            <h2>Network Design for
              FIRE DETECTOR</h2>
            <p>The "Fire Detector" project is a cutting-edge endeavour that aims to revolutionize fire
              safety and prevention through the development of an intelligent fire alarm system.
              Traditional fire alarm systems often suffer from false alarms and limited situational
              awareness, leading to inefficiencies and potential safety risks. In contrast, Smart
              Fireguard utilizes advanced sensor technologies and real-time data analysis to create
              a highly responsive and accurate fire detection and prevention system.

            <h2>Vipra Homes</h2>
            <p>As a part of the project assigned by the ADIT instructors, we, Cloud 9, are working on 
              a real-time project for an upcoming venture named "VIPRA," founded by prominent 
              Calicut-based builders Praveen and Vipin, who have been working in the construction 
              field for the past 20 years. Our project is a website that includes the complete details 
              about the company "VIPRA." The website includes 5 pages that consist of a home 
              page, about page, services page, projects page, and contact page. Customers can 
              inquire about the projects uploaded on the website with the help of an enquiry form 
              included in it. The functional requirements for the project encompass HTML, CSS, 
              Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

            <p>This study provides an analysis of iPhone prices and ratings, examining the relationship
